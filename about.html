        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">A brief introduction and things I like.</p>
        <section>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                I have connected well with computers from a young age. I made my own webpage at around the age of 11 though I must admit I used Microsoft Publisher 2003 and it wasn't functional at all. I remember the website was supposed to imitate a games website. I
                spent a lot of my childhood behind a monitor as I got into gaming. I was very much into MMORPG games at that time. As I grew older I got more and more into technology and I learned to appreciate how it can change our world.

            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>
                Besides computer stuff I don't really have hobbies though I think I should really get out of the house more. In my free time I like to play video games, listen to music, watch movies and sometimes binge watch TV shows. I enjoy building computers and messing
                around with them. I'm the sort of person that will break something just to have to fix it. Though I was never really active as a child I have recently started getting into fitness and gym if that can be considered a hobby.

            <h3>More stuff about me and likes</h3>
            <p>
                Open Source - I highly praise people who work on open source projects. Not only does it promote freedom but also gives people the oportunity of getting involved in improving the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because of the above I dislike the direction companies such as Microsoft are taking. I believe users should be allowed to use the operating system as they want to, especially if they paid for it. And don't get me started on all the surveilence stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love Android and everything about it but I still respect iPhones. They look pretty and do what they're supposed to do. I don't particularily like Apple but some of the stuff they released was good. I think MacBook Pros (2015 and earlier) are good machines.
                macOS is a very pretty operating system and in some ways a lot more polished than Windows.
            </p>
            <p>
                I procrastinate a lot.
