            <h2>Literature Review</h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                As the web has become increasingly popular amongst people due to the demand and use of things such as online social networks, online shopping and online banking concerns have been raised regarding information security. This is mostly due to the personalization
                settings these services provide which collects user data. (Toch, Wang, & Cranor, 2012, p. 3-4). This however is not the only concern, as hackers have also taken attraction to the web, targeting vulnerable users through means of brute-force
                attacks and social engineering. (Öğütçü, Testik, & Chouseinoglou, 2016, p. 84).
            </p>
            <h2>Potential causes for exposure</h2>
            <p>
                The web is widely used today by many people. It is rapidly growing and more and more people resort to using it to do everyday tasks. To make these services more user friendly and helpful, the creators of these services have implemented personalization
                tools that can help the content adapt to user based on their habits, depending on what kind of service is is. This can vary from personalized advertisements to personalized search results. This of course means that data has to be collected
                from the users and this raises concerns because of the risks involved, mostly regarding who can access this data. (Toch et al., 2012, p. 3-4).
            </p>
            <p>
                Taking social networking websites as an example, a big amount of data is collected from the user in order for their experience to be enhanced. Social networks are vastly used by people all around the globe. “In 2011, the worldwide average for Facebook
                was 40 min for 800 million users, according to Los Angeles Times (2011)”. (Mansour, 2016, p. 348). In the case of Facebook for instance, user information as well as liked posts and pages are collected thus allowing Facebook to recommend
                tailored content to the users and provide personalized advertisement. This again raises concerns because this data could be exposed and abused, making users very precarious. (Mansour, 2016, p. 348-349)
            </p>
            <p>
                The “cloud” is also at risk. The cloud is not only used for storage, but also to make sure users have their data available on all devices. This in turn also uses user data to further personalize the experience. “The Internet of Things” is a term used
                when describing multiple devices interconnected using the cloud allowing for smart devices to communicate with each other. By collecting user data, these devices can be more useful and bring tailored results and perform personalized actions.
                Because cloud services are not created for one specific user, it can be hard to predict what sort of privacy controls would be suitable for each user. This in turn creates a gap which attackers can get around. (Henze et al., 2016, p. 701-702).
            </p>
            <p>
                Businesses can also be affected by user information exposure. If they somehow get hacked and user information gets exposed, users will very likely stop trusting the service and maybe even cease to use it and recommend their peers to stop using it too.
                It can be extremely difficult for the business to recover after an occurrence of such, so it is in their best interest to ensure they mitigate these risks. (Bansal & Zahedi, 2015, p. 62-63).
            </p>
            <h2>Mitigating information exposure</h2>
            <p>
                Depending on the circumstances, information exposure on the web can be mitigated. Both the user and content provider must play a part in this. Taking the personalization example as a focus point, it can be noted that some of the risks can be reduced by
                giving the user more control over the privacy settings. This would in turn mean that users who choose to have the least amount of data collection would make it harder for attackers to gather the data. This of course comes at a cost, as
                personalized services would not be as reliable and useful anymore. (Toch et al., 2012, p. 212)
            </p>
            <p>
                Because the popularity of Online Social Networks (OSNs) has risen dramatically over the last few years, this has sparked a lot of interest for hackers as there are many targets and a lot of data available. (Patsakis, Zigomitros, Papageorgiou, & Galván-López,
                2014, p. 531). Most of these online social network services provide users with the ability to choose their own privacy settings. By opting to using stronger and stricter privacy settings, users can greatly reduce the risks related to data
                theft. This does not solve the problem though, as some users might ignore the privacy risks and choose lesser settings allowing them to become vulnerable. (Patsakis et al., 2014, p. 532)
            </p>
            <p>
                More and more online services are implementing 2-factor authentication. This is a big step forward in mitigating personal information exposure related to hacking. When users want to log into a service, they are sent a unique code, usually by SMS to their
                provided phone number, and are required to send it back, usually by inputting the code back into the website. This method ensures that the user trying to log in is the rightful user and not an intruder. (Siadati, Nguyen, Gupta, Jakobsson,
                & Memon, in press, p. 3)
            </p>
            <p>
                This is still not a final solution, as hackers have found ways in which they can social engineer their way through and using phishing attacks. They can impersonate the service provider, tricking users into sending the access code to the attacker. This
                in turn grants the hacker access. (Siadati et al., in press, p. 4-5). A way to reduce the risk is by making sure the message sent to the user is as descriptive as possible. In a study, it has been observed that an aggressive attacker can
                lure as many as 50% of users which was then reduced to 8% by implementing abuse-proof verification messages. (Siadati et al., in press, p. 24)
            </p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                The web is a very broad area and risks associated with personal information exposure will always be there. The service providers as well as the users must work together in mitigating them as much as possible. Mitigating personal information exposure is
                not just dealing with attacks, but also detecting those before they might even occur. This paper has outlined some factors that could contribute to personal information exposure and ways in which they can be mitigated.
