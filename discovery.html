            <h2>Introduction to markup</h2>
            <p>
                The lecture showed us how markup is used in order to present information on the web. In the practical I created a simple index.html page with a title, header and a paragraph. I then learned how to upload files over SFTP to my virtual machine and use it
                to publish the website using the http-server command.
            </p>

            <h2>Separating form and content</h2>
            <p>
                I this lecture I learned how to use cascading stylesheets in order to separate form and content. I was taught that this is a crucial task as it keeps things neat and allows for easier maintenance and troubleshooting and readability.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the practical I made another simple example.html page in which I added some ids and classes to my HTML and used CSS to stylize it. I learned that style can be put in the HTML file but is best kept separate in a .css file which is linked in the HTML
                file.
            </p>

            <h2>Addressing</h2>
            <p>
                In this lecture I learned how web addresses work, about DNS lookup, IP addresses and other things such as SSH, hostnames, ports etc. In the practical I made another simple page in which I added links.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the practical I created a new webpage and gave it some links and learned how to use CSS to manipulate the way it looks and behaves.
            </p>

            <h2>Using Images</h2>
            <p>
                In the lecture I learned how to use images and make them behave differently using CSS. I learned how to link to images stored locally as well as images stored elsewhere. In the practical I applied these new skills and made a simple page that had the university’s
                logo. This logo was edited with CSS so that it resizes with the browser window. I also learned not to use hot links to images. I also learned that videos and sound files can also be added to pages.

            <h2>Text Editors</h2>
            <p>
                In the lecture I was introduced to using the Atom text editor and how to increase productivity and ease of use using plugins such as Emmet, atom-beautify, vim-mode and how to theme the editor to my liking. I chose atom as my main editor because I like
                the idea of open source software and it also has a huge amount of useful plugins.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the practical I played around with atom, had a go at creating snippets (i decided not to get into that as I like the way Emmet works). I also left the default themes on because I really like them (One Dark).
            </p>

            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>
                This lecture introduced me to the meaning of the word design. I learned that it doesn't only have to do with how something looks but also on how it can be used. I was introduced to ways to make my website have a good design by considering the target audience
                and not annoy my users.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the practical in groups we sorted out cards based on categories and uploaded the results to moodle. Through this I learned how important it is to make sure things are properly linked and that there is an hierarchy to content and that it is easy for
                users to find it.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Usability</h2>
            <p>
                In this practical I had a go at starting to design my website’s structure and exchanged the results with my group partner, comparing our results.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Basic Scripting</h2>
            <p>
                In the lecture I was shown how using Javascript can make a web page more interactive. An example of this is using canvas. I was also introduced to how backend node servers can be used to make an online game.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this practical I had a go at understanding what the script does and had a go at trying to cheat so that I could be the first on the leaderboard. Through this I learned how to use the script tag and add javascript to my website.
            </p>

            <h2>Website Marking Scheme</h2>
            <p>
                In this lecture I saw how the marking scheme works and how to assess our peers and in which areas I need to look into to make sure I cover it with our coursework and get extra marks. I also learned how to use validation websites to make sure my HTML and
                CSS is correct and see if there are any warnings/errors.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the practical I did research on what elements such as em, i, b, u and strong do whilst also learning about the importance of validation. I had an attempt at validating my homepage and it came up with one small error which was easily fixed. I will make
                sure to add an up-to-date link to my site which will make it easier for visitor to see if the website successfully validates.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            <p>
                In the lecture I was introduced to accessibility options on the web and how people with disabilities might find it difficult to access websites if proper precautions were not taken by developers. I now know that the html must be clean and used properly
                in order to allow screen readers to work and not to use things such as too many icons or flashing text.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the practical as a group we used glasses that mimic conditions such as blindness and gloves with wood inside to mimic arthritis. We then tried to use websites like that and get the experience, further proving that accessibility is a crucial consideration.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Graphics and SVG</h2>
            <p>
                In the lecture I was introduced to scalable vector graphics, when they appropriate to use and how to implement them in a web page. I also learned about PNG and JPEG and how lossy and lossless formats should be used on the web and about file sizes. I learned
                that SVG images can be created using XML as well as software like Inkscape.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the practical I had a go at creating a simple SVG image using Inkscape. This has helped me understand where it is appropriate to use SVG and will most likely implement my logo for the website and an SVG.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Dynamic pages and databases</h2>
            <p>
                In this lecture I was shown how dynamic content can be added to HTML and change it based on database entries. The lecturer showed us a simple online shopping site and how it accesses and populates categories and items from a database using mysql. I was
                also introduced to API and a bit of node.js and PHP. I learned that while static pages (such as the one i created for my coursework are not always useful and all important websites have dynamic content.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the practical I carried on with my coursework and made sure the website was looking good and able to run on the university servers and that it can validate successfully.
            </p>

                These are links to sources I have used, mostly in order to learn new stuff or when I encountered issues with my website.
