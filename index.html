            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Hi and welcome to my website. I hope you'll like it and find it easy to navigate and use. I will give a little background on what I tried to accomplish with this website and the technologies used to create it. Please note that I haven't optimised the
                website to work with Internet Explorer so please use a modern browser (Anything but IE).
            </p>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                I am a fan of Google's material design which lead me to making my website look like this. I think material design promotes simplicity while still looking elegant and in my opinion is easier on the eyes, unlike gradients. Overdoing it is no good though
                (wasting screen estate *ahem* Windows 10 *ahem*).
            </p>
            <p>
                Other than that I tried to keep it as simple as possible - no flashing or moving elements to distract the reader. Content is the main focus. I tried my best to make things blend and keep contrast in mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                The colour scheme I chose represents the colours of our university (sans the green buttons). I was a bit sceptical with the colour scheme but I think it looks OK. It's not too bright and annoying and neither boring and dull.
            </p>
            <p>
                The font I used is called Roboto and is one of Google's fonts. I really like this font together with the Ubuntu font although Ubuntu doesn't look as good.

            <h3>Technologies</h3>
            <p>
                I have used HTML5 and CSS3 to build this website. This was the first time I have used them properly. I wanted to use CSS as much as possible without relying too much on Javascript. I only used JS for the shadow under the header (you can see it if as you
                scroll up and down) because I couldn't find a way to do it in CSS. It uses the jQuery library so the script itself is pretty short and the syntax is easy to understand.
            </p>

            <h3>UX</h3>
            <p>
                Because I followed the material design guidelines I wanted the website to be as simplistic and minimalistic as possible. My aim was not necessarily to impress users and make them go "wow!" but rather try my hardest not to annoy them and help them have
                a good experience using the website. Buttons are large and clear, the navigation bar follows as the user scrolls down which reduces the amount of scrolling needed to access other pages. The Roboto font is clear and pleasing to look at
                and the colours blend well together and create a nice contrast.
            </p>

            <h3>Compatibility</h3>
            <p>
                I tried my best to make the website compatible with all mainstream browsers. Getting it to work in Chrome, Firefox and Edge has been simple and straight forward. Internet Explorer was a nightmare as it made my entire website look and behave completely
                different. I am not very concerned anyway as I think IE should be ditched by everyone and I think developing for it is a waste of time. Though still not perfect, Edge definitely improved things.

            <h3>Accessibility</h3>
            <p>
                I tried to make my website as user-friendly as possible and kept people with disabilities in mind. By making it simple and not using icons and other elements that are hard to understand I think my website is very easy to use and navigate. I used a font
                that is clean and easy on the eyes and the colour scheme is not too bright and flashy. Buttons are big enough to easily see and are obvious to help people with short sight.
